<p>Git Alias is a collection of git version control shortcuts,
functions, and commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shortcuts such as <code>s</code> for
<code>status</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements such as <code>optimize</code> to do a prune and
repack with recommended settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Workflows such as <code>topic-begin</code> to create a new topic
branch for a new feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Visualizations such as <code>graphviz</code> to show logs and
charts using third-party tools.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-use-this">Why use this?</h3>
<p>We are creating this alias list because we type these commands many
times daily, and we want the commands to be fast and also accurate.</p>
<p>We often work on teams, across many companies and organizations, and
using multiple shells. We want to count on a set of aliases. For shorter
commands, such as <code>s</code> for <code>status</code>, fast speed is
nice. For longer commands, such as <code>repacker</code>, accurate
settings are important.</p>
